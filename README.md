## Fedora COPR repo for Veracrypt

This is a fork of [bgstack15's veracrypt COPR package](https://gitlab.com/bgstack15/stackrpms/tree/master/veracrypt) repo. It contains the spec files used in generating an SRPM which are in-turn used to create a .rpm package for Fedora.

COPR builds done [here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/cyfrost/packages/builds/) and the upstream Veracrypt repo lies [here](https://github.com/veracrypt/VeraCrypt).

### Installing Veracrypt on Fedora
