## Fedora COPR repo for Veracrypt

This is a fork of [bgstack15's veracrypt COPR package](https://gitlab.com/bgstack15/stackrpms/tree/master/veracrypt) repo. It contains the spec files used in generating an SRPM which are in-turn used to create a .rpm package for Fedora.

COPR builds done [here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/cyfrost/packages/builds/) and the upstream Veracrypt repo lies [here](https://github.com/veracrypt/VeraCrypt).

Note: Builds are only done for x86_64, other chroot environments (i368, aarch64, ppc64) are intentionally not built for. If you'd like for them to be included, please raise an issue.


### Installing Veracrypt on Fedora
